Convert NT8 ATM Strategies for use in Quantower

Summary: I currently use several ATM Strategies in NinjaTrader that conveniently attach themselves to trades I place using NT8 Chart Trader. I would like to have the same functionality in Quantower. 

Details: The ATM Strategies are simply chase and trail stop strategies (Chase the bid, Multi-level trailing stop with Break Even). The multiple ATM Strategies that I want to convert are simply different levels of stops and trigger variables.  I have the XML files from Ninja for each these and I can also describe in words them if that makes things easier (such as BE at 10 ticks, buffer 2, etc...).

Concessions: I do not need chase if it proves difficult or possibly breaks the code. If it is not possible to attach to a chart trader in QT like it is doable in NT8, I require a GUI chart overlay with a Buy Bid/Sell Ask/Market Buy/Market Sell button menu and a dropdown with the parameters we want to run with input boxes that attach themselves to the subsequent trade placed through the GUI box..  (If GUI is the way we go, I will provide a photoshop image of the style).

Successful completion of this project will lead to optional additional indicator conversion work.

My required timeframe to complete: < 1 day

Thank yoU!
